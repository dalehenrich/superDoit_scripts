# superDoit .solo and .stone scripts
This is a collection of .solo and .stone scripts that I use regularly in my work ... I'm making it public on the off chance that other folks find the scripts useful as is or as examples of writing superDoit scripts.

| script name | type | description |
| ----------- | ---- | ----------- |
| installStandardProjects.stone | Rowan | Install named projects (superDoit, t2f2t, gsteststats, etc.) into a Rowan stone. Projects are expected to already be present in $ROWAN_PROJECTS_HOME. |
